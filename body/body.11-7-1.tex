  In this section we give a brief but general account of sound generation, 
  concentrating particularly on compact sources (i.e. the source region is 
  small compared to the wavelength of sound, or equivalently the Helmholtz 
  number is small). This description draws heavily on Chapter 7 of the textbook 
  by Dowling and Ffowcs Williams [1]. 

  The first step is to recall a result from section 4.3.1: the sound pressure 
  radiated by a small sphere vibrating sinusoidally at frequency $\omega$ is 

  $$p=\dfrac{i \omega \rho_0 q}{4 \pi r} e^{i \omega(t-r/c)} \tag{1}$$ 

  where $r$ is the distance to the listener from the centre of the sphere, $q$ 
  is the total volume flux displaced by the pulsating sphere, and $\rho_0$ is 
  the density of air. Noting that $i \omega q$ is simply the frequency-domain 
  expression for the rate of change $\dot{q}$, we can see that all the 
  frequency components of a general waveform $\dot{q}(t)$ have identical 
  behaviour: an outgoing spherical wave at speed $c$, with amplitude decreasing 
  inversely with distance. We can deduce the time-domain equivalent formula for 
  the observed pressure at distance $r$: 

  $$p(t)=\dfrac{\rho_0 }{4 \pi r} \dot{q}(t-r/c) . \tag{2}$$ 

  We will shortly use this result in a similar manner to the Rayleigh integral 
  (see section 4.3.2), to determine the total sound pressure generated by a 
  spatially distributed sound source region by performing a suitable 
  integration. 

  The next step is to revisit the derivation of the linearised wave equation 
  from section 4.1.1, and add in any possible source terms. The derivation 
  involved two fundamental equations: mass conservation and momentum balance 
  (or Newton's law). Each of those could have an associated source term. 

  The equation of mass conservation then reads 

  $$\dfrac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \rho_0 \nabla \cdot \underline{v} = m 
  \tag{3}$$ 

  where $\underline{v}$ is the air velocity vector. This is equation (15) of 
  section 4.1.1, with the addition of the term $m$ on the right-hand side. This 
  allows for the possibility of mass being added to the system: it describes 
  the rate at which mass is added, per unit volume, at a given position in the 
  source region. The kind of application we are interested in involves air 
  flowing out of a tone-hole, in which case if the volume flow rate is $q$ per 
  unit volume, then $m=\rho_0 q$. 

  In a similar vein, the equation of momentum balance now reads 

  $$\nabla p + \rho_0 \dfrac{\partial \underline{v}}{\partial t} = 
  \underline{f} , \tag{4}$$ 

  which is the same as equation (16) from section 4.1.1 with the addition of 
  the term $\underline{f}$ describing external force per unit volume that may 
  be applied to the air at a given position. 

  Now we proceed much as before. We can substitute $\rho = p/c^2$ in equation 
  (3), then eliminate $\underline{v}$ between equations (3) and (4) to leave an 
  equation for $p$. To achieve this we take $\partial/\partial t$ of equation 
  (3) and we take the divergence of equation (4), then subtract one from the 
  other. The result is 

  $$\dfrac{1}{c^2} \dfrac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} 
  \nabla^2 p = \rho_0 \dot{q} \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} \nabla \cdot \underline{f} 
  .\tag{5}$$ 

  We see the familiar wave equation, with two source terms on the right-hand 
  side. We can conclude that within the approximation of linearised acoustics 
  these are the only two possible ways in which sound can be generated. To see 
  what they mean, we can consider them in turn. The first term, $\rho_0 
  \dot{q}$, can be related directly to the result in equation (2) derived from 
  the pulsating sphere. The sphere problem had a concentrated excitation 
  involving $\rho_0 \dot{q}$, while equation (5) has a distributed version of 
  exactly the same thing, expressed per unit volume. So, just as we did with 
  the Rayleigh integral in section 4.3.2, we can integrate equation (2) over 
  the volume $V$ containing the source region, where $\rho_0 \dot{q}$ is 
  non-zero. The result is 

  $$p(\underline{x},t)=\rho_0 \int \int 
  \int_V{\dfrac{\dot{q}(\underline{y},t-|\underline{x} -- \underline{y}|/c)}{4 
  \pi |\underline{x} -- \underline{y}|} d^3 \underline{y}} \tag{6}$$ 

  where the position vectors $\underline{x}$ and $\underline{y}$ point to the 
  receiver position and an element within the source region, as indicated in 
  Fig.\ 1, and $d^3 \underline{y}$ denotes the element of volume with respect 
  to the position $\underline{y}$. The equation looks at first sight more 
  complicated than equation (2), but this is simply because we need the more 
  cumbersome expression $|\underline{x} -- \underline{y}|$ in place of the 
  radial distance $r$: each element of the source is at a different distance 
  from the receiver. 

  If the source region is small compared to the wavelength of sound and 
  receiver is very distant from the source, the variation in $|\underline{x} -- 
  \underline{y}|$ for different positions $\underline{y}$ is very small. Under 
  those circumstances, equation (6) reduces to a simple approximate form: 

  $$p(\underline{x},t) \approx \dfrac{\rho_0}{4 \pi R} \dot{Q}(t-R/c) \tag{7}$$ 

  where 

  $$\dot{Q}=\int \int \int_V{\dot{q} \mathrm{~} d^3 \underline{y}} \tag{8}$$ 

  and 

  $$R=|\underline{x} -- \underline{Y}| \tag{9}$$ 

  where 

  $$\underline{Y}=\dfrac{1}{V} \int \int \int_V{\underline{y} \mathrm{~} 
  d^3\underline{y}} \tag{10}$$ 

  is the mean position vector indicating the middle of the source region. 
  Equation (7) is exactly the same as equation (2): it describes 
  omnidirectional monopole sound radiation with a strength $\dot{Q}$ given by 
  simply adding all the distributed contributions (equation (8)). 

  Returning to equation (5), we now look at the effect of the second source 
  term. We can use the same integration approach as in equation (6), to obtain 

  $$p(\underline{x},t)=- \int \int \int_V{\dfrac{\nabla \cdot 
  \underline{f}(\underline{y},t-|\underline{x} -- \underline{y}|/c)}{4 \pi 
  |\underline{x} -- \underline{y}|} d^3 \underline{y}} . \tag{11}$$ 

  If we then looked for a similar approximation to equations (7) and (8), we 
  would hit a snag. The equivalent of equation (8) would involve the integral 

  $$\int \int \int_V{\nabla \cdot \underline{f} \mathrm{~}d^3 \underline{y}}, 
  \tag{12}$$ 

  and we can easily show that this integral is zero. We apply the divergence 
  theorem (see section 4.1.4 equation (11)) to a surface $S$ which entirely 
  encloses the source volume $V$, far enough out that $\underline{f}=0$ 
  everywhere on the surface. Then 

  $$\int \int \int_V{\nabla \cdot \underline{f} \mathrm{~}d^3 \underline{y}} = 
  \int \int_S{\underline{f} \cdot d\underline{A}} = 0 . \tag{13}$$ 

  So the net monopole strength of this kind of sound source is zero: in fact, 
  it describes a dipole source. To see this clearly, we use a trick --- closely 
  related to the trick we used in section 4.3.1 when we first met dipoles. 
  Suppose the equation we are trying to solve had been 

  $$\dfrac{1}{c^2} \dfrac{\partial^2 p_1}{\partial t^2} -- \nabla^2 p_1 = 
  \underline{f} \tag{14}$$ 

  rather than equation (5). Then we would know the solution by our integration 
  procedure: it would be 

  
  $$p_1(\underline{x},t)=\int_V{\dfrac{\underline{f}(\underline{y},t-|\underline{x} 
  -- \underline{y}|/c)}{4 \pi |\underline{x} -- \underline{y}|} d^3 
  \underline{y}} . \tag{15}$$ 

  Now we can take the divergence of both sides of equation (14) to deduce the 
  solution we really want: 

  $$\dfrac{1}{c^2} \dfrac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} -- \nabla^2 p = -- \nabla 
  \cdot \underline{f} \tag{16}$$ 

  with 

  $$p(\underline{x},t) = -\nabla \cdot p_1(\underline{x},t) = -\nabla \cdot 
  \int_V{\dfrac{\underline{f}(\underline{y},t-|\underline{x} -- 
  \underline{y}|/c)}{4 \pi |\underline{x} -- \underline{y}|} d^3 \underline{y}} 
  \tag{17} .$$ 

  From here, we can obtain an approximate form for a compact source region, 
  similar to equations (7) and (8): 

  $$p(\underline{x},t) \approx -\nabla \cdot \left[ 
  \dfrac{\underline{F}(t-R/c)}{4 \pi R} \right] \tag{18}$$ 

  where 

  $$\underline{F} = \int \int \int_V{\underline{f} \mathrm{~} d^3 
  \underline{y}} \tag{19}$$ 

  and $R$ is given by equation (9). 

  To put this result in a more intuitive form, suppose we choose to align our 
  $z$-axis with the direction of the net force $\underline{F}$. Write the 
  magnitude of the force $F(t)$. Then equation (18) becomes 

  $$p(\underline{x},t) \approx -\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \left[ 
  \dfrac{F(t-R/c)}{4 \pi R} \right] . \tag{20}$$ 

  As we did in section 4.3.1 we can relate a small change in $z$ to a small 
  change in $R$ via the polar angle $\theta$ with the $z$-axis: $dR=dz \cos 
  \theta$. So finally 

  $$p(\underline{x},t) \approx -- \cos \theta \dfrac{\partial}{\partial R} 
  \left[ \dfrac{F(t-R/c)}{4 \pi R} \right]$$ 

  $$ = \dfrac{\cos \theta}{4 \pi}\left[ \dfrac{1}{Rc} \dfrac{dF}{dt} + 
  \dfrac{F}{R^2} \right] . \tag{21}$$ 

  This is exactly the form we found for a dipole source in section 4.3.1. In 
  the far field, only the first term in the square brackets matters. 

  We have seen that within the scope of linear acoustics there are only two 
  types of sound source: anything producing a net variation in volume gives a 
  monopole source, and anything applying a net force to the fluid gives a 
  dipole source. But there is a third kind of source, if we take account of the 
  nonlinearity of the full governing equations for fluid motion. The underlying 
  theory was developed by Sir James Lighthill [2] back in the 1950s, when noise 
  from jet aircraft was beginning to be a major concern. 

  Lighthill's key insight was that you could take the full, nonlinear equations 
  governing fluid flow, and manipulate them into a form 

  $$<\mathrm{Wave~equation}>\mathrm{~}= \mathrm{~}<\mathrm{Other~stuff}>$$ 

  and then interpret the $<\mathrm{Other~stuff}>$ as a source term, creating 
  sound waves. This formulation is usually called ``Lighthill's acoustical 
  analogy''. We will give a brief account here, but we need not go deeply into 
  the rather complicated mathematics associated with this subject. We have laid 
  the groundwork for the analysis in section 11.2.1. The steps are very similar 
  to the derivation of the wave equation given above: we will take the 
  equations of mass conservation and momentum balance and combine them to give 
  a single equation, in this case one governing the behaviour of fluid density 
  rather than pressure. 

  We will use the notation of section 11.2.1, denoting the three Cartesian 
  coordinates by $(r_1,r_2,r_3)$ rather than $(x,y,z)$ so that we can express 
  the equations in a compact form. Equation (5) from that section expressed 
  conservation of mass in the form 

  $$\dfrac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -- \nabla \cdot (\rho \underline{u}) = 
  -\sum_{j=1}^3\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r_j} \left( \rho u_j \right) . 
  \tag{22}$$ 

  Equation (20) from that section expressed momentum balance in the form 

  $$\rho \dfrac{Du_i}{Dt}=\sum_{j=1}^3{\dfrac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial 
  r_j}}\mathrm{~~~for~~}i=1,2,3 \tag{23}$$ 

  where $\sigma_{ij}$ is the stress tensor, and for our present purpose we have 
  not included the term expressing a body force --- we have already dealt with 
  external forces in the earlier discussion. Expanding out the convective 
  derivative $D/Dt$, this equation gives 

  $$\rho \dfrac{\partial u_i}{\partial t}=- \rho \sum_{j=1}^3{u_j 
  \dfrac{\partial u_i}{\partial r_j}} + \sum_{j=1}^3{\dfrac{\partial 
  \sigma_{ij}}{\partial r_j}}\mathrm{~~~for~~}i=1,2,3 . \tag{24}$$ 

  Now we can combine equations (22) and (24) to show 

  $$\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho u_i) =\dot{\rho} u_i + \rho \dot{u_i}$$ 

  $$= -\sum_{j=1}^3\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r_j} \left( \rho u_j \right) u_i 
  \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} \rho \sum_{j=1}^3{u_j \dfrac{\partial u_i}{\partial 
  r_j}} + \sum_{j=1}^3{\dfrac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial r_j}}$$ 

  $$= \sum_{j=1}^3 \dfrac{\partial}{\partial r_j} \left[\sigma_{ij} 
  \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} \rho u_i u_j \right] \mathrm{~~~for~~}i=1,2,3 
  \tag{25}$$ 

  Now we can take $\partial/\partial t$ of equation (22) and subtract the 
  divergence of equation (25) to obtain 

  $$\dfrac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial t^2} = -\sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 
  \dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial r_i \partial r_j} \left[\sigma_{ij} 
  \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} \rho u_i u_j \right] . \tag{26}$$ 

  Finally, if we subtract from both sides of this equation a term 

  $$c^2 \nabla^2 \rho = c^2 \sum_{i=1}^3 \dfrac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial 
  r_i^2} \tag{27}$$ 

  we can express the result in the form we are looking for: 

  $$\dfrac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial t^2} \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} c^2 \nabla^2 
  \rho = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \dfrac{\partial^2 T_{ij}}{\partial r_i 
  \partial r_j} \tag{28}$$ 

  where Lighthill's stress tensor $T_{ij}$ is defined by 

  $$T_{ij} = \rho u_i u_j \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} \sigma_{ij} 
  \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} c^2 \rho \delta_{ij} \tag{29}$$ 

  where $\delta_{ij}$ denotes the unit matrix as usual. 

  We need a slightly more general expression for $\sigma_{ij}$ than the one 
  given in equation (21) of section 11.2.1, because we do not want to assume 
  incompressible flow. We need not go into details, but it is always possible 
  to write 

  $$\sigma_{ij} = -p \delta_{ij} + \tau_{ij} \tag{30}$$ 

  where $\tau_{ij}$ is a symmetric matrix (or, more correctly, tensor) called 
  the deviatoric viscous stress tensor. It vanishes for inviscid flow. If we 
  assume the usual relation $p=c^2 \rho$, the final form of the Lighthill 
  tensor is 

  $$T_{ij} = \rho u_i u_j \mathrm{~}-\mathrm{~} \tau_{ij} . \tag{31}$$ 

  Looking back at equation (18), we saw that a dipole field was given by the 
  divergence of a monopole field. Equation (28) now shows that the sound field 
  generated by the nonlinearity of flow involves a double divergence, which 
  immediately tells us that it will be quadrupole in character.
